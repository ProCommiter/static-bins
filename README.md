# static-bins
statically linked post-exploitation tools for linux

copied most of [https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries)'s linux binaries, plus those compiled by me, and those copied from debian/centos official repositories

i do not provide build scripts (it's too much work), you can choose to trust my binaries, or not, you better reverse them yourself, make sure you are safe

for [emp3r0r](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r) users, you can find files for `vaccine` module [here](./vaccine)
