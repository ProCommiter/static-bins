# static-bins
statically linked post-exploitation tools for linux

copied most of [https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries)'s linux binaries, plus those compiled by me

i do not provide build scripts, you can choose to trust my binaries, or not, you better reverse them yourself, make sure you are safe
